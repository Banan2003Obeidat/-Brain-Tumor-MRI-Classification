# 🧠 Brain Tumor MRI Classification – Graduation Project 🎓 
This project aims to classify brain tumors using deep learning models on MRI scans. It detects and categorizes images into four types: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, or No Tumor. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains high-resolution images in a structured format.

## 📊 Dataset
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset 

Classes:

Glioma Tumor

Meningioma Tumor

Pituitary Tumor

No Tumor

Total Images: 7022 (approx.)

### 📌 Project Highlights
##### 🔬 1. Preprocessing 
Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation

Class-wise balanced train-test split

Data generators for each mode

##### 🤖 2. Models Implemented
